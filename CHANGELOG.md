### Changed
- Buttons: default method of installation requires now to load the toolbar (no more single buttons support), from there, any button can be loaded as desired.
- Buttons: the buttons bar now shows a message when no buttons have been added, left clicking shows a popup with available buttons presets. Right clicking opens the menu to configure the toolbar or add buttons manually.
